## Contributions
As the backend lead, I implemented a modular, scalable architecture using **Java Spring Boot**, ensuring robust API design with **RESTful services** for seamless frontend-backend interaction. Utilizing **Spring Security** with JWT for secure authentication, I designed and optimized the data layer with **Spring Data JPA** and **Hibernate**. This setup supports efficient data operations on **PostgreSQL** and ensures smooth integration for all core finance management features. Additionally, I deployed **Swagger-UI** for streamlined API documentation and testing.
